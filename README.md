# Problem 1:
The solution and project files are compatible with Visual Studio 2015.
Location highlights:
###Problem1/Problem1 contains the C++ source and header files.
###Problem1/testdata100k.txt contains an example dataset generated by the Test.exe program
###Problem1/Release/Test.exe is a precompiled version of the program. Example arguments:
To generate a dataset: Test.exe (new dataset file name) gen (number of birth&death years to generate)

To use a dataset: Test.exe (dataset file name) use
###Problem1/sampleoutput.txt contains output of running "Test.exe Problem1/testdata100k.txt use"
The program attempts to solve the problem in two ways:
####Search 1: A sequential search of each year from 1900-2000 to find the year wtih the most alive.
####Search 2: A binary search to find the year with the most alive.

# Problem 2:
Location highlights:
### schema.sql contains a backup of the Player table used in the php script
### slot_machine_spin_results.php takes GET variables as input. The script validates the input and (if valid) updates the Player table appropriately.
Example output for slot_machine_spin_results.php?playerID=1&hash=24988d9aa627ea723a4769c83e481a76&coinsWon=100&coinsBet=30
would be ["1","One",2167,50,43.34]
